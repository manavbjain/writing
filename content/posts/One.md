This site was long overdue but better late than never, right? Welcome to my slice on the World Wide Web. This is where I plan to share cool projects, things, and events from my everyday life. Along with this site being a blog, I intend to use this space as a digital garden and a personal wiki.

I plan to also write technical guides on my setup, cool tools, walkthroughs of TryHackMe/Hack the Box, and much more.

I hope this space to become representative of my learning experiences as I dive deeper into the realm of cybersecurity and security research.
